The goal of this exercise is to develop a better understanding of React as well as JS in the browser vs in Node by creating a very basic (not full feature) clone of React.

- To run the test: `npm i && npm test`
- To view the UI: `open index.html` or manually open the file in a browser
- To view the [example from React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-react-in-one-minute): `open react-example.html` or manually open the file in a browser
