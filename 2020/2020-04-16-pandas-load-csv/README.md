## Goal

My friend just wanted to help learning how to read a csv file into python with pandas, so this is just
a little test project to try that. When you run it, there will be no output. I just reads the file
into memory and then quits.

## Setup

Only dependency is docker, then just follow the instructions below to run it.

## How to run it

Run some python script: `./python file.py`

## If you want to install a dependency

- Edit Dockerfile
- Rebuild: `docker-compose build python`
