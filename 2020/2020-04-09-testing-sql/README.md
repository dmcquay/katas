# Goal

You have some kind of basic API that runs some queries and returns results. At least one query is simple and one is more complex. Explore various strategies for testing them.

# What is the app?

We'll create some subset of an e-commerce database.

We'll have one endpoint that returns an order by ID.

We'll have another endpoint that returns the average order size per day.
